	abstract = {Technological advancements in deep learning for speech and voice have contributed to a recent expansion in applications for voice cloning, synthesis and generation. Invisibilised stakeholders in this expansion are numerous absent bodies, whose voices and voice data have been integral to the development and refinement of these speech technologies. This position paper probes current working practices for voice and speech in machine learning and AI, in which the bodies of voices are “invisibilised". We examine the facts and concerns about the voice-Body in applications of AI-voice technology. We do this through probing the wider connections between voice data and Schaefferian listening; speculating on the consequences of missing Bodies in AI-Voice; and by examining how vocalists and artists working with synthetic Bodies and AI-voices are ‘bringing the Body back’ in their own practices. We contribute with a series of considerations for how practitioners and researchers may help to ‘bring the Body back’ into AI-voice technologies.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a project enabling non-coders to control a Poppy Ergo Jr. robotic arm with Dynamixel servomotors. Originally using a Raspberry Pi and Pixl board, various constraints related to importation led to adopting a ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. A client-server architecture was implemented for remote control, with creative coding platforms (p5.js, Processing, Pure Data, Python) as clients. The server, utilizing a two-layer architecture, manages communication and interfaces with the ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. The OSC and WebSocket protocols were chosen for communication due to their flexibility and their ease of use. Clients were developed for each platform, leveraging compatibility layers.},
