  abstract = {The advancement of AI-tools for musical performance has inspired exciting opportunities for interaction with musical-AI-agents. Interactions between humans and AI-agents in musical settings entail dynamic exchanges of control and power, and framings of AI-agents’ roles by human performers. We probe these framings and power-control exchanges through qualitative thematic lenses, drawing from post-phenomenology, matters of fact and concern and feminist science and technology studies. We contribute with a novel interdisciplinary analytical method as a tool for developers and designers of AI systems to help visibilise and examine the implicit, the wider connections and entangled filaments in Human–AI musical interactions.},
