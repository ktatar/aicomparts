	abstract = {This paper introduces a project enabling non-coders to control a Poppy Ergo Jr. robotic arm with Dynamixel servomotors. Originally using a Raspberry Pi and Pixl board, various constraints related to importation led to adopting a ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. A client-server architecture was implemented for remote control, with creative coding platforms (p5.js, Processing, Pure Data, Python) as clients. The server, utilizing a two-layer architecture, manages communication and interfaces with the ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. The OSC and WebSocket protocols were chosen for communication due to their flexibility and their ease of use. Clients were developed for each platform, leveraging compatibility layers.},
