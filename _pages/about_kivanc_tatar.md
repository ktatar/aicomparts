I am an artist/technologist/researcher, working in the intersection of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Interactive Arts, and Music. The computational approaches in my research have been integrated into interactive artworks, musical and audiovisual performances; which have reached a global audience in seventeen countries on five continents.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Interactive AI at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden; and a WASP-HS fellow.
