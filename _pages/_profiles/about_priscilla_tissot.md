Priscilla Tissot is an IT student in her final year of her masters degree in France with a major in AI. She has contributed to various projects during her internships, including a study of the influence of different data augmentation strategies on a Deep Learning algorithm applied to papyrus reconstruction, the integration of a new DSL (Domain Specific Language) into a project to exploit programme synthesis and also a study of social biases in LLMs and the implementation of strategies to mitigate them. She is really interested in AI and its sociological influences, so she is also working on a development framework to generate a variety of images on stable diï¬€usion, a Deep Learning architecture for image generation, to expose the biases of an image generation model. Indeed, art corresponds to a set of aesthetic means of creation that allow messages and/or emotions to be conveyed. AI in art, such as image generation, is therefore the vector and reflection of sociological developments.
