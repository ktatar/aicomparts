# TRA385 - Emerging Technologies in Artistic Practices

![](../assets/img/tra385.webp "Emerging Technologies in Artistic Practices")

## Description

[TRA385 - Emerging Technologies in Artistic Practices](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/course-selection-and-registration/select-courses/choose-a-tracks-course/emerging-technologies-through-artistic-innovation/) is a project based course in which students explore emerging technologies for producing and realising an artwork. The course delivers workshops on Artificial Intelligence for Music and Multimedia, Quick Fabrication, Woodwork and Metalwork, Textile, Sensors and Electronic, and the students exhibit their final artworks in the TRA385 course in a public exhibition.

Innovation is often guided by a curiosity-based exploration with new technology. Emerging technologies naturally involve different disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence, sensors, creative coding, and ecology inspired approaches, big or small data, interactivity, and web development. Emerging technologies through artistic innovation is a hands-on, project-based course that encourages curiosity ignited exploration of emerging technologies through artistic imagination.
The event is co-presented by the Tracks initiative (Chalmers Central) and the AI-Infused Computational Arts Research Group (Computer Science and Engineering Department) at Chalmers University of Technology.

## About Tracks

[Tracks](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/course-selection-and-registration/select-courses/choose-a-tracks-course/) is a unique educational initiative regarding learning and learning environments that prepares the university for the needs of tomorrow. Tracks are exactly what Chalmers students are offered – tracks between different programmes in the form of elective courses, where the choices are guided by personal interest. The framework of Tracks provides opportunities for individualised study and collaboration between students, industry, the community and academia.
We look forward to welcoming you to FUSE Box 2 to showcase Chalmers’ next generation of artist-technologists.
