## Vision

The conventional Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence emphasize gestalt, which is the end-product, and optimization while addressing questions such as: which architecture performs better or faster? How do we generate high-quality content such as image/video/audio/music? While these questions and gestalt are relevant with their significant contributions to society as the matters of fact, investigations into the AI technology creation processes, actors, and stakeholders can benefit societal discourses towards matters of concerns. Artistic imaginationâ€¦ Artistic realms provide opportunities to investigate AI technology both as their technology facts of new artistic opportunities in greater autonomy, and as their societal and cultural matters of concern. 

## Mission

The perspectives from third-wave feminism combined with recent methodologies of Science Technology Studies can create a bridge that connects matters of facts such as accuracy, efficiency, optimization, reliability, and explainability; to matters of concerns such as ethics, inclusivity, sustainability, accessibility, and privacy. A better future society with technologies of greater autonomy, can only be achieved with interdisciplinary perspectives. With artistic imagination in technology making, care-fully troubling processes involved, get your coffees ready folks, we have a lot to cover!
