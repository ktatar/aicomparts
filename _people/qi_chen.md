## Bio

Qi Chen was a Masterâ€™s student in Applied Data Science with a passion for exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and creativity. She is deeply fascinated by how AI can serve as a medium for self-expression, much like the arts. Currently, her research focuses on "Investigating Curriculum Learning in Deep Generative Models Using Western Classical Music," where she trains deep learning models to learn music progressively, mirroring human learning processes.

Qi has previously worked on generating nearby molecules through ECFP4 fingerprint analysis and explored multiple models to enhance image resolution quality. Beyond her academic pursuits, she enjoys traveling, writing, immersing herself in nature, and discovering diverse cultures. Qi believes that AI, much like art, has the power to reflect and amplify human creativity and innovation.
