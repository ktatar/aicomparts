	abstract = {Notating electroacoustic music can be challenging due to the uniqueness of the instruments employed. Electronic instruments can include generative components that can manipulate sound at different time levels, in which parameter variations can correlate non-linearly to changes in the instrument’s timbre. The way compositions for electronic instruments are notated depends on their interfaces and the parameter controls available to performers, which determine the state of their sound-generating system. In this article, we propose a notation system for generative synthesis based on a projection from its parameter space to a timbre space, allowing to organise synthesiser states based on their timbral characteristics. To investigate this approach, we introduce the Meta-Benjolin, a state-based notation system for chaotic sound synthesis employing a three-dimensional, navigable timbre space and a composition timeline. The Meta-Benjolin was developed as a control structure for the Benjolin, a chaotic synthesiser. Framing chaotic synthesis as a specific instance of generative synthesis, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the state- and timbre-based representation we designed based on the thematic analysis of an interview study with 19 musicians, who composed a piece using the Meta-Benjolin notational interface.},

	abstract = {Neural Audio is a category of deep learning pipelines which output audio signals directly, in real-time scenarios of action-sound interactions. In this work, we examine how neural audio-based artificial intelligence, when embedded in digital musical instruments (DMIs), shapes embodied musical interaction. While DMIs have long struggled to match the physical immediacy of acoustic instruments, neural audio methods can magnify this challenge, requiring data collection, model training and deep theoretical knowledge that appear to push musicians toward symbolic or conceptual modes of engagement. Paradoxically, these same methods can also foster more embodied practices, by introducing opaque yet expressive behaviors that free performers from rigid technical models and encourage discovery through tactile, real-time experimentation. Drawing on established perspectives in DMI embodiment literature, as well as emerging neural-audio-focused efforts within the community, we highlight two seemingly conflicting aspects of these instruments: on one side, they inherit many “disembodying” traits known from DMIs; on the other, they open pathways reminiscent of acoustic phenomenology and soma, potentially restoring the close physical interplay often missed in digital performance.},

	title = {A Deep Learning Framework for Musical Acoustics Simulations},
	abstract = {The acoustic modeling of musical instruments is a heavy computational process, often bound to the solution of complex systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical models can achieve a high level of accuracy, but they may take up to several hours to complete a full simulation, especially in the case of intricate musical mechanisms. The application of deep learning, and in particular of neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces, has the potential to revolutionize how acoustics PDEs are solved and noticeably speed up musical simulations. However, extensive research is necessary to understand the applicability of such operators in musical acoustics; this requires large datasets, capable of exemplifying the relationship between input parameters (excitation) and output solutions (acoustic wave propagation) per each target musical instrument/configuration. With this work, we present an open-access, open-source framework designed for the generation of numerical musical acoustics datasets and for the training/benchmarking of acoustics neural operators. We first describe the overall structure of the framework and the proposed data generation workflow. Then, we detail the first numerical models that were ported to the framework. This work is a first step towards the gathering of a research community that focuses on deep learning applied to musical acoustics, and shares workflows and benchmarking tools.},

What would be a non-normative approach in finding novel artistic possibilities of speech synthesis and text-to-speech with Deep Learning? This paper delves into SpeechBrain, OpenAI and CoquiTTS voice and speech models with the perspective of an experimental vocal practitioner. Exploratory Research-through-Design guided an engagement with pre-trained speech synthesis models to reveal their musical affordances in an experimental vocal practice. We recorded this engagement with voice and speech Deep Learning technologies using auto-ethnography, a novel and recent methodology in Human-Computer Interaction. Our position in this paper actively subverts the normative function of these models, provoking nonsensical AI-mediation of human vocality. Emerging from a sense-making process of poetic AI nonsense, we uncover the generative potential of non-normative usage of normative speech recognition and synthesis models. We contribute with insights about the affordances of Research-through-Design to inform artistic working processes with AI models; how AI-mediations reform understandings of human vocality; and artistic perspectives and practice as knowledge-creation mechanisms for working with technology.},

We examine the facts and concerns about the voice-Body in applications of AI-voice technology. We do this through probing the wider connections between voice data and Schaefferian listening; speculating on the consequences of missing Bodies in AI-Voice; and by examining how vocalists and artists working with synthetic Bodies and AI-voices are ‘bringing the Body back’ in their own practices. We contribute with a series of considerations for how practitioners and researchers may help to ‘bring the Body back’ into AI-voice technologies.},

Seeking to unsettle these murky waters, this paper critically examines the example of Holly+, a deep neural network that generates raw audio in the likeness of its creator Holly Herndon. Drawing from theoretical concerns and considerations from speculative feminism and care ethics, we care-fully trouble the structures, frameworks and assumptions that oscillate within and around Holly+. We contribute with several considerations and contemplate future directions for integrating speculative feminism and care into musical-AI agent and system design, derived from our critical feminist examination.},

	abstract = {The research in Deep Learning applications in sound and music computing have gathered an interest in the recent years; however, there is still a missing link between these new technologies and on how they can be incorporated into real-world artistic practices. In this work, we explore a well-known Deep Learning architecture called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These architectures have been used in many areas for generating latent spaces where data points are organized so that similar data points locate closer to each other. Previously, VAEs have been used for generating latent timbre spaces or latent spaces of symbolic music excepts. Applying VAE to audio features of timbre requires a vocoder to transform the timbre generated by the network to an audio signal, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we apply VAEs to raw audio data directly while bypassing audio feature extraction. This approach allows the practitioners to use any audio recording while giving flexibility and control over the aesthetics through dataset curation. The lower computation time in audio signal generation allows the raw audio approach to be incorporated into real-time applications. In this work, we propose three strategies to explore latent spaces of audio and timbre for sound design applications. By doing so, our aim is to initiate a conversation on artistic approaches and strategies to utilize latent audio spaces in sound and music practices.},
