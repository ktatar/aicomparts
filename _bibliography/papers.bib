	title = {A Deep Learning Framework for Musical Acoustics Simulations},
	abstract = {The acoustic modeling of musical instruments is a heavy computational process, often bound to the solution of complex systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical models can achieve a high level of accuracy, but they may take up to several hours to complete a full simulation, especially in the case of intricate musical mechanisms. The application of deep learning, and in particular of neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces, has the potential to revolutionize how acoustics PDEs are solved and noticeably speed up musical simulations. However, extensive research is necessary to understand the applicability of such operators in musical acoustics; this requires large datasets, capable of exemplifying the relationship between input parameters (excitation) and output solutions (acoustic wave propagation) per each target musical instrument/configuration. With this work, we present an open-access, open-source framework designed for the generation of numerical musical acoustics datasets and for the training/benchmarking of acoustics neural operators. We first describe the overall structure of the framework and the proposed data generation workflow. Then, we detail the first numerical models that were ported to the framework. This work is a first step towards the gathering of a research community that focuses on deep learning applied to musical acoustics, and shares workflows and benchmarking tools.},

	title = {Sounding out extra-normal AI voice: Non-normative musical engagements with normative AI voice and speech technologies},
	abstract = {How do we challenge the norms of AI voice technologies? What would be a non-normative approach in finding novel artistic possibilities of speech synthesis and text-to-speech with Deep Learning? This paper delves into SpeechBrain, OpenAI and CoquiTTS voice and speech models with the perspective of an experimental vocal practitioner. Exploratory Research-through-Design guided an engagement with pre-trained speech synthesis models to reveal their musical affordances in an experimental vocal practice. We recorded this engagement with voice and speech Deep Learning technologies using auto-ethnography, a novel and recent methodology in Human-Computer Interaction. Our position in this paper actively subverts the normative function of these models, provoking nonsensical AI-mediation of human vocality. Emerging from a sense-making process of poetic AI nonsense, we uncover the generative potential of non-normative usage of normative speech recognition and synthesis models. We contribute with insights about the affordances of Research-through-Design to inform artistic working processes with AI models; how AI-mediations reform understandings of human vocality; and artistic perspectives and practice as knowledge-creation mechanisms for working with technology.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements in deep learning for speech and voice have contributed to a recent expansion in applications for voice cloning, synthesis and generation. Invisibilised stakeholders in this expansion are numerous absent bodies, whose voices and voice data have been integral to the development and refinement of these speech technologies. This position paper probes current working practices for voice and speech in machine learning and AI, in which the bodies of voices are “invisibilised". We examine the facts and concerns about the voice-Body in applications of AI-voice technology. We do this through probing the wider connections between voice data and Schaefferian listening; speculating on the consequences of missing Bodies in AI-Voice; and by examining how vocalists and artists working with synthetic Bodies and AI-voices are ‘bringing the Body back’ in their own practices. We contribute with a series of considerations for how practitioners and researchers may help to ‘bring the Body back’ into AI-voice technologies.},

Originally using a Raspberry Pi and Pixl board, various constraints related to importation led to adopting a ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. A client-server architecture was implemented for remote control, with creative coding platforms (p5.js, Processing, Pure Data, Python) as clients. The server, utilizing a two-layer architecture, manages communication and interfaces with the ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 board. The OSC and WebSocket protocols were chosen for communication due to their flexibility and their ease of use. Clients were developed for each platform, leveraging compatibility layers.},

	abstract = {The ethics of AI as both material and medium for interaction remains in murky waters within the context of musical and artistic practice. The interdisciplinarity of the field is revealing matters of concern and care, which necessitate interdisciplinary methodologies for evaluation to trouble and critique the inheritance of `residue-laden' AI-tools in musical applications. Seeking to unsettle these murky waters, this paper critically examines the example of Holly+, a deep neural network that generates raw audio in the likeness of its creator Holly Herndon. Drawing from theoretical concerns and considerations from speculative feminism and care ethics, we care-fully trouble the structures, frameworks and assumptions that oscillate within and around Holly+. We contribute with several considerations and contemplate future directions for integrating speculative feminism and care into musical-AI agent and system design, derived from our critical feminist examination.},

	abstract = {The research in Deep Learning applications in sound and music computing have gathered an interest in the recent years; however, there is still a missing link between these new technologies and on how they can be incorporated into real-world artistic practices. In this work, we explore a well-known Deep Learning architecture called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These architectures have been used in many areas for generating latent spaces where data points are organized so that similar data points locate closer to each other. Previously, VAEs have been used for generating latent timbre spaces or latent spaces of symbolic music excepts. Applying VAE to audio features of timbre requires a vocoder to transform the timbre generated by the network to an audio signal, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we apply VAEs to raw audio data directly while bypassing audio feature extraction. This approach allows the practitioners to use any audio recording while giving flexibility and control over the aesthetics through dataset curation. The lower computation time in audio signal generation allows the raw audio approach to be incorporated into real-time applications. In this work, we propose three strategies to explore latent spaces of audio and timbre for sound design applications. By doing so, our aim is to initiate a conversation on artistic approaches and strategies to utilize latent audio spaces in sound and music practices.},

	abstract = {Raw Music from Free Movements is a deep learning architecture that translates pose sequences into audio waveforms. The architecture combines a sequence-to-sequence model generating audio encodings and an adversarial autoencoder that generates raw audio from audio encodings. Experiments have been conducted with two datasets: a dancer improvising freely to a given music, and music created through simple movement soniﬁcation. The paper presents preliminary results. These will hopefully lead closer towards a model which can learn from the creative decisions a dancer makes when translating music into movement and then follow these decisions reversely for the purpose of generating music from movement.},

The implementation includes a fully working application with a graphical user interface, called interpolate\_two, which enables practitioners to generate timbres between two audio excerpts of their selection using interpolation and extrapolation in the latent space of audio frames. Our implementation is open source, and we aim to improve the accessibility of this technology by providing a guide for users with any technical background. Our study includes a qualitative analysis where nine composers evaluated the Latent Timbre Synthesis and the interpolate\_two application within their practices.},
