## Abstract

The recent advancement in text generation technology driven by artificial intelligence (#AI) has brought new opportunities and challenges to storytelling, calling for collaboratory storytelling (#co-storytelling) with AI. Co-storytelling with AI is expected to create a unique experience for the writer/user. Despite the promise and expectation, little is known about people’s actual experience with AI co-storytelling, including users’ perception of this co-storytelling, the interaction patterns between the user and the AI system and the storytelling strategy used. This gap in knowledge may limit the potential of co-storytelling with AI, and hamper our understanding of AI, storytelling and users. Therefore, this study presents a content analysis of the posts on Reddit made by users of AI Dungeon, a system which produces text-based role-playing stories made by generative AI.
