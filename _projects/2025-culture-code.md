# The Culture Code: Generative AI, Data, and Societal Futures

## Event Details

**"Event Date:** February 13th, 2026 (Friday)  
**Event Type:** Research Seminar, Panel Discussion & Artistic Performance

---

## Abstract

Generative AI technologies are transforming cultural production, creative practices, and societal narratives at an unprecedented scale. While these systems offer new opportunities for democratizing access to cultural resources and enabling innovative forms of expression, they also raise critical concerns around bias, representation, sustainability, and ethics. This event, part of the **AI Futures of Culture and Memory** WASP-HS research cluster and funded by the VR networking project The Culture Code: Developing Deep Sustainable AI, brings together scholars, practitioners, and artists to examine the societal impact of deep generative models.

The program will feature **research seminars, expert panels, and artistic performances**, creating a unique space for interdisciplinary dialogue and creative exploration. Topics include synthetic data, cultural bias, and representational politics, alongside reflections on how generative AI reshapes notions of authorship, creativity, and historical consciousness. The event aims to foster collaboration toward designing inclusive and ecologically responsible AI systems that support sustainable cultural futures.

## Presenters

### Erica Johnson
Professor, Deputy head of [Department of Thematic Studies (TEMA)](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/tema), [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en)

> Bio: My research explores how the world becomes data. With a background in Science & Technology Studies and medical humanities, I’m looking at the nexus of ontologies, epistemologies and AI. What happens when the data that represents the world meets AI? 
https://liu.se/en/employee/erijo72

### Francis Lee
Associate Professor, Södertörn University & Chalmers University of Technology

> Bio: Francis Lee is an Associate Professor at Södertörn University, Media Technology and Chalmers University of Technology at the Division of Media Technology and the Division for Science, Technology, and Society. His research examines how digital technologies—such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, and big data infrastructures—shape our understanding of the world.
>
> Lee's research is grounded in the tradition of Science and Technology Studies (STS), focusing on how technologies shape how we classify, value, and understand society. Drawing on STS perspectives that emphasize the co-production of technology and the social order, his work investigates how technologies become intertwined with knowledge production. His current projects explore how artificial intelligence and big data are reshaping biomedical research practices and knowledge production.

### Anna Foka
Professor, Department of Archives, Libraries, and Museums at Uppsala University 

> Bio: Anna Foka is Professor in Digital Humanities at the Department for [Archives, Museums and Libraries (ABM)](https://www.abm.uu.se/?languageId=1), the director of the international research cluster [AI Futures of Culture and Memory](https://futuresai.net), the founder of the [Centre for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/digital-humanities-and-social-sciences), and the coordinator of [DASH: Data, Culture and Society, Critical Perspectives](https://www.dash-doctoralschool.se/). Anna is the national mentor for AI in [SKERIC](https://www.skeric.org). Her research interest revolve around critical perspectives on the nexus of technology, culture and memory. 

### Coppélie Cocq
Professor in Sámi studies and digital humanities at Umeå University, and Research director at Humlab, and Deputy director of the research infrastructure Huminfra.
> Bio: I have a Ph.D. in Sami Studies (2008) with the thesis *Revoicing Sámi narratives. North Sámi storytelling at the turn of the 20th century* (Sámi Dutkan, Umeå University).
>
> I conduct research within the focus area of [digital practices](https://www.umu.se/en/humlab/research/digital-practice/). My research interests are cultural forms of expression, storytelling and narrative (from oral to digital) as well as critical studies in minority and indigenous research. Ethical and methodological perspectives on digital research, for instance the consequences of digitalisation and AI for our societies and in research, are other topical issues in my research.
>
>I am deputy director of the [research infrastructure Huminfra](https://www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/huminfra/). and co-editor for the Journal JAF: A Global Quarterly.

### Andre Holzapfel
Associate Professor of Media Technology with specialization in Sound and Music Computing, [Division of Media Technology and Interaction Design](https://www.kth.se/hct/mid/), KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

>Bio: My research focuses on the intersection between music and technology, for instance, by using computational analyses in studies of music corpora or by investigating the development of technology for creative purposes. I have contributed to the computational analysis of rhythm in the field of Music Information Retrieval, and have focused my ethnographic work on music and dance in Crete, Greece. My multidisciplinary background helps me to investigate the potential of combining quantitative, computational methods with qualitative, ethnographic methods in music research, an investigation that I like to refer to as Computational Ethnomusicology.
