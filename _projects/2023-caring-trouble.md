The Caring Trouble is an interdisciplinary methodology<d-cite key="cotton_caring_2023"></d-cite> for analysing and revealing the (in)visibilised facts and concerns embedded in AI Artworks.

This framework draws from interdisciplinary theory from science and technology studies (STS), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI ethics. Specifically, our framework engages with speculative feminism; matters of fact, concern and care; and feminist data ethics. This framework--when applied to the analysis of an AI artwork or artistic application of an AI tool--is intended to assist in identifying what is *visibilised* and *invisilised* by the usage of AI.
