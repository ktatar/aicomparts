## Description
Latent Timbre Synthesis is a new audio synthesis method using deep learning <d-cite key="tatar_latent_2020"></d-cite>. The synthesis method allows composers and sound designers to interpolate and extrapolate between the timbre of multiple sounds using the latent space of audio frames. The implementation includes a fully working application with a graphical user interface, called interpolate_two, which enables practitioners to generate timbres between two audio excerpts of their selection using interpolation and extrapolation in the latent space of audio frames. Our implementation is open source, and we aim to improve the accessibility of this technology by providing a guide for users with any technical background. Our study includes a qualitative analysis where nine composers evaluated the Latent Timbre Synthesis and the interpolate_two application within their practices.

The visualizations below illustrate a latent space generated by a Variational Autoencoder. On the right, the green and red dots represent latent vectors of audio frames of two audio examples from the dataset, while the green is the latent vectors of a synthesized sound generated by interpolating the latent vectors of two original audio files.
